Summary of Changes:
Externalized CSS & JS: Your styles are in style.css and scripts in script.js.
Language Toggle:
Buttons "العربية" / "English" in the header.
data-ar and data-en attributes added to almost all user-facing text elements in index.html.
script.js handles toggling body classes (lang-ar, lang-en) and updating dir attribute, then iterates through elements to switch their innerText and placeholder values.
Admin Mode & Editing Buttons:
"وضع التعديل" / "Edit Mode" button in the header.
post-actions div with "تعديل" / "Edit" and "حذف" / "Delete" buttons placed within each article. These are hidden by default and shown when "Edit Mode" is active via the admin-mode class on the body.
"إضافة مقال جديد" / "Add New Article" button above the main content, also toggled by admin mode.
script.js includes demo alert functions for these buttons.
Search Bar: Integrated into the header as requested.
Social Sharing Buttons: Added to each post (after the "Read More" link) and the footer, using Font Awesome icons.
